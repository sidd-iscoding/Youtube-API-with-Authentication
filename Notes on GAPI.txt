The GAPI library offers a simple, flexible way to call Google APIs from your browser. GAPI is Google’s client 
library for browser-side JavaScript. It’s used in Google Sign-in, Google Drive, and thousands of internal and 
external web pages for easily connecting with Google APIs.

To make a request in GAPI, we need to do following:
    Loading the gapi client
    Initializing the client with our Google API Discovery Document
    Make an API request
    Handle the API response results

An API Discovery document describes the surface for a particular version of an API. The information includes API 
name, API version, API description, resource schemas, method definitions, authentication requirements, and more. 
The JavaScript client library uses the information to generate corresponding JavaScript methods that applications
can use. If an API explicitly documents its discovery URL, always use it as-is to load the JavaScript client
 library.
After loading an API Discovery Document, the JavaScript client library automatically generates JavaScript methods
for interacting with the API. For each method defined in the API Discovery Document, a corresponding method is 
constructed on the gapi.client object.   (refer: https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/blob/master/docs/discovery.md)
